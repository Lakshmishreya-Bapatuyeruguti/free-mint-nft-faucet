# NFTFaucet

NFTFaucet is a weekend project designed to assist developers in minting NFTs on test networks. With the help of NFTFaucet, users can mint ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens on any network and utilize these AI-generated NFTs for development and testing purposes.

This GitHub project contains two sub-repositories: the Image Generator and the NFT Mint smart contract Hardhat repository.
